# MapleWeaponCreator

Tool which allows anyone to create entirely new weapons with a single drawn frame, taking a single PNG image and turning it into an importable, game-ready XML file!
 
Included are reference frames for generating 1H/2H/Spear+Polearm weapons, so users can just draw over the outline with a custom weapon, or use it as a guideline for expected sizing.

To Do: Licensing for referenced executables

Fallback Uses:

rotsprite 1.0
